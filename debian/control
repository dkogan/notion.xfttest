Description: tiling tabbed window manager designed for keyboard users
 Notion divides the screen into tiles and places windows in these tiles
 by default.  Each tile has a set of tabs for the windows within it.
 It also allows windows to be made 'floating' and placed freely.  Notion
 can be controlled through the keyboard alone or together with a mouse.
 .
 Notion can be configured and extended using the Lua language.  It also
 supports extension modules written in C.
